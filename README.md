# ContainerFS
ZIP filesystem using libfuse and libzip

## Requirements
- [libfuse3](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)
- [libzip](https://github.com/nih-at/libzip)

## Compiling
```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# run the generated binary to get more help on how to use it
./zipfs
```

## Testing
The tests directory contains two scripts and a zip file that contains symlinks
```
# read from the specified file CHUNK_SIZE bytes at a time every TIMEOUT seconds
python3 idle_read.py PATH_TO_FILE CHUNK_SIZE TIMEOUT

# generate zip file with a diractory structure with given depth,
# number of directories per parent directory, number of lines that are contained
# in the generated files at the leaves of the directory tree and optionally
# the path to the generated file (by default ./archive.zip)
python3 deep_zip.py DEPTH BASE LINE_COUNT [PATH_TO_GENERATED_ZIP]
```

## Roadmap
- [x] getattr
- [x] readlink
- [x] open
- [x] read
- [x] readdir
- [x] release
- [x] init

## Testing
- [x] Autogenerated zips with given depth, width, file size
- [x] Zips with symbolic links
- [x] Paralel buffered read
